Experience 
======
* **Optimal IM-EDP Pairs for Seismic Fragility Analysis of Segmental Tunnels**
  * This work examines favored PSDM and IM-EDP pair through extensive FEM simulations. A **bi-linear model** is presented to enhance PSDM's regression accuracy across various ground motion intensities. Subsequently, **optimal IM-EDP pairs** and **fragility curves** are generated for segmental tunnels with **varying soil conditions and burial depths**.
  * **Used theory:** Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis, Finite Element Method.
  * **Used simulation tool:**  OpenSees (for Simulation) & Python & Matlab (for Statistical Analysis).
