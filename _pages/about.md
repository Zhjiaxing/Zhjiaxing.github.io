- I am now a master's student in [Department of Civil Engineering](http://ce.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm), supervised by Prof. [Chao Zhang](https://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/zhangchao).

- I use numerical modeling techniques, along with probabilistic and statistical tools, to quantify the seismic response characteristics and effectively manage risks for underground structures. Recently, I am pursuing to apply the knowledge-guided machnie learning, e.g.,physics-informed neural networks and operator learning,  to solve problems in earthquake engineering.

- I am looking for a PhD position! Please feel free to contact me via **zhou_jx@hnu.edu.cn** or **WeChat at 15145663684**, if you are interested in me.

- Our paper titled ["Significance and formulation of ground loss in tunneling-induced settlement prediction: a data-driven study"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11440-023-01859-8) is published in Acta Geotechnica. This study comprehensively assessed the existing formulations of ground loss, and proposed a better data-driven model that can accurately capture the relationships between the ground loss and related features, e.g., operating parameters. The proposed model is further integrated into classical settlement solutions, yielding a hybrid model that shows great performance in tunneling-induced settlement.
