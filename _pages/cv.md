Experience 
======
* **Optimal IM-EDP Pairs for Seismic Fragility Analysis of Segmental Tunnels**
  * This work examines favored PSDM and IM-EDP pair through extensive FEM simulations. A **bi-linear model** is presented to enhance PSDM's regression accuracy across various ground motion intensities. Subsequently, **optimal IM-EDP pairs** and **fragility curves** are generated for segmental tunnels with **varying soil conditions and burial depths**.
  * **Used theory:** Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis, Finite Element Method.
  * **Used simulation tool:**  OpenSees (for Simulation) & Python & Matlab (for Statistical Analysis).

* **Domain Reduction Method for Seismic Analysis of Deep and Shallow Buried Tunnels**
  * Seismic response of underground structures depends on regional ground motion characteristics and local soil-structure interaction. We propose two types of Domain reduction methods (DRM): an open-form and a close-form DRM, to elucidate response characteristics in underground structures subjected to regionally-scaled earthquakes.
  * **Used theory:** Finite Element Method, Finite Difference Method, Domain Reduction Methods.
  * **Used simulation tool:**  SW4 (for Regional Earthquake Simulation), OpenSees (for SSI Simulation).

* **POD-based Reduced Order Model for Dynamic Response Simulation**
  * We utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the fundamental modes and their associated modal weight coefficients for complex dynamic systems characterized by substantial nonlinearity. This procedure enables us to develop a reduced-order model for these systems, in conjunction with Machine Learning (ML) methods.
  * **Used theory:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Machine Learning (ML).
  * **Used simulation tool:**  Python.

* **Sophisticated Numerical Modeling for Seismic Analysis of Segmental Tunnels**
  * We first proposed the fiber beam-based segmental tunnel model for simulating segmental tunnelsâ€™ response under seismic shaking, validating comprehensively its accuracy using experimental dataset. The model was then used to study segmental tunnel seismic behavior, underscoring its applicability and stability.
  * **Used theory:** Fiber Beam Element Theory, Finite Element Method
  * **Used simulation tool:**   OpenSees (for simulation)

* **Component-based Fragility Assessment for Segmental Tunnel Under Bidirectional Excitations**
  * A 3D fiber beam model is developed to simulate the seismic response of a staggered segmental tunnel under bidirectional excitations. Thereafter, its seismic fragility is evaluated at component and systematic levels using a component-based fragility framework, with incorporating the effect of soil condition and burial depths.
  * **Used theory:** Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis, Finite Element Method.
  * **Used simulation tool:**  OpenSees (for Simulation) & Python & Matlab (for Statistical Analysis).

* **Development of Sophisticated Scaled Physical Model for RC Segments**
  * Physical model testing stands as one of the most potent methods to explore the mechanical traits of underground structures. To date, there is still lack of a physical model embodying both material and geometric nonlinearity for RC segments. We pioneered a scaled physical RC segments model, addressing this gap, using the flexure capacity similarity criterion.
  * **Used theory:** Flexure Capacity Similarity Criterion.

* **Mechanical Behavior of Tunnel Under Near Field Engineering Disturbance**
  * Near filed engineering disturbances, e.g., like tunnel and foundation pit excavation, constitute a significant cause of structural deterioration in segmental tunnels during their operational phase. We evaluate the bending moment and soil pressure distribution for segmental tunnels using a multi-dimensional displacement-controlled soil model box test device.
  * **UUsed experiment method:** Multi-dimensional Displacement-controlled Soil Model Box Test
  * **Used simulation tool:**  Similarity Criterion of Capacity
