Research

**(ⅰ) Seismic fragility of shield tunnel in complex soil conditions at both local and regional levels**  
(Main contributor, Supervised by *Dr. Zhang*, Collaborated with *Zixiong Lang*, *Yibo Shao* and *Yuhao Ren*)  
* **Sophisticated Numerical Modeling for Seismic Analysis of Segmental Tunnels**
  * We first proposed the fiber beam-based segmental tunnel model for simulating segmental tunnels’ response under seismic shaking, comprehensively validating its accuracy using experimental dataset. The model was then used to study segmental tunnel seismic behavior, underscoring its applicability and stability.
  * **Used theory:** Fiber Beam Element Theory, Finite Element Method
  * **Used simulation tool:**   OpenSees (for simulation)

* **Optimal IM-EDP Pairs for Seismic Fragility Analysis of Segmental Tunnels**
  * This work examines favored PSDM and IM-EDP pair through extensive FEM simulations. A **bi-linear model** is presented to enhance PSDM's regression accuracy across various ground motion intensities. Subsequently, **optimal IM-EDP pairs** and **fragility curves** are generated for segmental tunnels with **varying soil conditions and burial depths**.
  * **Used theory:** Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis, Finite Element Method.
  * **Used simulation tool:**  OpenSees (for Simulation) & Python & Matlab (for Statistical Analysis).

* **Domain Reduction Method for Seismic Analysis of Deep and Shallow Buried Tunnels**
  * Seismic response of underground structures depends on regional ground motion characteristics and local soil-structure interaction. We propose two types of Domain reduction methods (DRM): an open-form and a close-form DRM, to elucidate response characteristics in underground structures subjected to regionally-scaled earthquakes.
  * **Used theory:** Finite Element Method, Finite Difference Method, Domain Reduction Methods.
  * **Used simulation tool:**  SW4 (for Regional Earthquake Simulation), OpenSees (for SSI Simulation).

* **POD-based Reduced Order Model for Dynamic Response Simulation**
  * We utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the fundamental modes and their associated modal weight coefficients for complex dynamic systems characterized by substantial nonlinearity. This procedure enables us to develop a reduced-order model for these systems, in conjunction with Machine Learning (ML) methods.
  * **Used theory:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Machine Learning (ML).
  * **Used simulation tool:**  Python.

* **Component-based Fragility Assessment for Segmental Tunnel Under Bidirectional Excitations**
  * A 3D fiber beam model is developed to simulate the seismic response of a staggered segmental tunnel under bidirectional excitations. Thereafter, its seismic fragility is evaluated at component and systematic levels using a component-based fragility framework, with incorporating the effect of soil condition and burial depths.
  * **Used theory:** Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis, Finite Element Method.

**(ⅱ) Evaluation of response mechanism of underground structure via hybrid experiments**  
(Active participant, Supervised by *Dr. Zhang*, Collaborated with *Zheng-an Liu* and *Huan Zhang*) 
* **Design of multi-dimensional displacement-controlled soil model box test device**

An Information Interaction Module is embedded in its control system for the achievement of the hybrid test for underground structures.
  * **Used theory:** Similarity Criterion.

* **Development of Sophisticated Scaled Physical Model for RC Segments**
  * Physical model testing stands as one of the most potent methods to explore the mechanical traits of underground structures. To date, there is still lack of a physical model embodying both material and geometric nonlinearity for RC segments. We pioneered a scaled physical RC segments model, addressing this gap, using the flexure capacity similarity criterion. This model retains all original features of RC segment, including even hand hole (Precision 0.1mm).
  * **Used theory:** Flexure Capacity Similarity Criterion.

* **Mechanical Behavior of Tunnel Under Near Field Engineering Disturbance**
  * Near filed engineering disturbances, e.g., like tunnel and foundation pit excavation, constitute a significant cause of structural deterioration in segmental tunnels during their operational phase. We evaluate the bending moment and soil pressure distribution for segmental tunnels using a multi-dimensional displacement-controlled soil model box test device.
