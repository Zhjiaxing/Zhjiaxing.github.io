======
* **Optimal IM-EDP Pairs for Seismic Fragility Analysis of Segmental Tunnels**
  * This work examines favored PSDM and IM-EDP pair through extensive FEM simulations. A bi-linear model is presented to enhance PSDM's regression accuracy across various ground motion intensities. Subsequently, optimal IM-EDP pairs and fragility curves are generated for segmental tunnels with varying soil conditions and burial depths.

<center> Structure of the proposed framework. More details will be posted in an official release. </center>



* **Quality index for construction big data in EPB shield tunneling**
  * **Quality index development:** Pioneer the first quality measure for construction big data in EPB shield tunneling, which consists of three components, i.e., representativeness, diversity, and informativeness
  * **Verify the effectiveness of the proposed quality index:** The quality index of data is quantitatively compared with the performance of the models developed by data via a correlation analysis, the high R-values that more than 0.9 confirms the effectiveness of the quality index

*  **Data-driven modeling for ground loss in EPB shield tunneling**
    * **Evaluation of existing methods for ground loss:** Survey the existing formulations for ground loss, and quantitatively evaluate them based on the collected field dataset 
    * **Hybrid model for tunneling-induced settlement:** Develop a random forest model for capturing the relationship between the ground loss and related features, which is integrated into the classical settlement solutions, yielding a hybrid model for tunneling-induced settlement

<center> A hybrid algorithm for settlement prediction. More details can be found in the published version. </center>

* **Transfer learning for chamber pressure prediction in EPB shield tunneling**
  * **Transfer learning framework for chamber pressure prediction:** Introduced the transfer learning methods, e.g., fine-tuning, CORAL, and MMD, for enhancing the generalization ability of existing models in predicting chamber pressure from different projects
  * **Performance of the transfer learning frameworks:** Utilize two filed datasets from Tianjin City and Changsha City to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected transfer learning methods in the few-shots problem of chamber pressure prediction

* **Surrogate model for structural response under dynamical loading**
  * **Surrogate model development:** We are the first to introduce deep neural operators e.g., DeepONet and FNO, into surrogate modeling for the response of underground structures under dynamical loading
  * **Transfer learning of surrogate model:** We implemented transfer learning methods for maintaining the effectiveness of the developed models under different geological conditions
