Seismic fragility assessment for segmental tunnels is crucial in urban lifeline system disaster management. This process involves probabilistically connecting ground motion intensity measures (IMs) and engineering demand parameters (EDPs) through a probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM). Despite its importance in refining seismic risk assessment, the appropriate pairing of IMs and EDPs for segmental tunnel fragility analysis remains uncertain. This study conducts a parametric numerical analysis to identify optimal IM-EDP pairs for segmental tunnels. Six hypothetical soil-segmental tunnel systems, varying in soil conditions and burial depths, are simulated using a validated numerical model. These models are subjected to 150 ground motions, resulting in 900 seismic response datasets. Utilizing these datasets, linear and bi-linear PSDMs are derived for each system through parametric statistical inference. Each type of these PSDMs combines four EDPs and two ground motion setsâ€”outcrop-based and soil surface-based. Subsequently, the optimal IM-EDP pairs are selected based on four regression parameters: correlation; efficiency; practicality; and proficiency. The findings demonstrate the superior performance of the bilinear PSDM over the linear model, notably enhancing predictive ability across a wider intensity range. For each type of PSDM, velocity and acceleration-related IMs from both ground motion suites prove more effective than displacement, time, and frequency-related IMs for all EDPs. Moreover, this study generates seismic fragility curves using the identified optimal IM-EDP pairs, serving as a valuable reference for effective seismic risk assessment and management of segmental tunnels.
