- I am now a master's student in [Department of Civil Engineering](http://ce.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm), supervised by Prof. [Chao Zhang](https://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/zhangchao).

- My research interests cover the development of physics-informed data-driven modeling methodology for engineering practice. Recently, I focused on utilizing scientific machine learning tools, particularly physics-informed neural networks, and operator learning to solve problems in engineering practice.

- I am looking for a PhD position! Please feel free to contact me via **renyuhao@hnu.edu.cn** or **WeChat at 18983815201**, if you are interested in me.

- We will participate in the 2nd TBM Tunneling Parameters Data Sharing and Machine Learning Competition.

- I attended HKUST(GZ) joint summer camp. Interesting journey!

- I attended the National Highway Tunnel Academic Annual Conference.

- Our paper titled ["Significance and formulation of ground loss in tunneling-induced settlement prediction: a data-driven study"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11440-023-01859-8) is published in Acta Geotechnica. This study comprehensively assessed the existing formulations of ground loss, and proposed a better data-driven model that can accurately capture the relationships between the ground loss and related features, e.g., operating parameters. The proposed model is further integrated into classical settlement solutions, yielding a hybrid model that shows great performance in tunneling-induced settlement.

- A collaborative paper with Ziheng titled ["A Kriging-Random Forest Hybrid Model for Real-time Ground Property Prediction during Earth Pressure Balance Shield Tunneling"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05128#:~:text=A%20kriging%2Drandom%20forest%20hybrid%20model%20is%20developed%20for%20real,selection%20thereby%20mitigate%20construction%20risks.) can be finded in arxiv.
