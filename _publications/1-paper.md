title: "Development and evaluation of a numerical model for seismic analysis of segmental tunnel"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/1-paper
excerpt: 'We developed a sophisticated fiber beam-based numerical model for a segmental tunnel, incorporating the non-linearities embedded in the assembly with acceptable computational costs. The proposed modelâ€™s accuracy is validated via a series of experimental data under three loading scenarios. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the mechanical response of segmental tunnel highly relies on the assembly configurations. The proposed model is implemented to investigate the seismic response of a typical segmental tunnel under various ground motions, demonstrating its applicability in seismic safety assessments, particularly in capturing the nonlinear response of segmental tunnels under high-intensity earthquakes.'
